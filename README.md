# practical-haskell

This repository is my exercises for the book _Practical Haskell: A Real World Guide to Pogramming_ by Alejandro Serrano Mena.

I reading the book as part of an online reading group organized by Haskell Amsterdam. Some exercies won't be in this repository, but will be in my Boost Note journal for the reading group (e.g., exercises that ask you to interact with ghci).

The repository is a single package with separate directories in src for each chapter. Each chapter will be one or more module.
